# Ranranbot
Ranran is going to creat a bot<br>
***
It seems that if I want to build a chat bot, I need to:<br>

1. Decide what chat protocol you want your bot to work on. Will it be IRC or facebook messenger or any other?

2. Study the protocol of the platform you have chosen for your bot to operate in. For instance with IRC protocol you can use the protocol specification to understand how your program must communicate. You can read about that here: Internet Relay Chat RFCs
   
4. Study text and string manipulation in Python and any libraries designed to make this easier. Chatbots must read text, isolate important words or phrases, identify which users are sending the message and many other things. This will require you to have strong knowledge of text and string processing. The quality of your chatbot is directly related to how talented you are at this skillset.
   
6. You will need to learn how to send text over the internet using Python. There are libraries for this.. youâ€™ll need to learn a little about ports and possibly also sockets if your not using a lib/module to simplify this. It is always worth it to attempt this part of it from scratch, just to learn how it works.. and then later you can learn to use someone elses module which will be easier to understand once you have learned a little about these things by yourself.
   
8. The last challenge is actually the hardest one. Writing the logic and algorithms that watch for textual ques and react to them the way you intend. This is the most complex part of writing good chatbots and many people will use frameworks so that they can go straight to coding this part of the script. Depending on exactly what you want your chat bot to actually do.. this can send you right down the AI rabbit hole where the level of complexity can quickly get to Phd.level code.
